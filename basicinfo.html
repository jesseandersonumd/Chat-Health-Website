While it’s important to wash your hands regularly throughout the day, it is especially important to wash your hands before touching your face and after using the bathroom, going into a public space, blowing your nose, coughing, removing your mask, helping someone who may be sick, and touching animals. If you do not have access to soap and water, use hand sanitizer that has at minimum 60% alcohol, and avoid touching your face if you haven’t washed your hands.</li>

                                    According to the CDC, the virus is believed to spread when someone with the virus comes into close contact (within 6 feet) with other individuals. The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets that are produced when someone coughs, talks, or sneezes; these droplets can then be inhaled into someone’s lungs. 
                                </li>

                                    Wearing a mask protects you and everyone around you. It’s possible to spread COVID-19 if you are asymptomatic (meaning you do not outwardly show symptoms), and the mask can protect others if you’re infected with the virus. If you do not have physical conditions that impede your breathing or prevent you from removing a mask without aid, wear a <a href='https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769441' target='_blank'>mask.</a>

                                    Let’s start by clarifying that anyone of any age and background can show symptoms that can range from mild to severe. Older people and people who are immunocompromised are at an increased risk of developing severe symptoms.

                                    The flu and COVID-19 are pretty different. They are both respiratory diseases, but COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 and the flu is caused by influenza viruses. 
                                </li>

                                    Their symptoms are fairly similar. Beyond symptoms shared by COVID-19 and the flu, as discussed above, COVID-19 may lead to a loss or change in taste or smell. 
                                </li>

                                    For the flu, people usually develop symptoms between 1-4 days after being infected. But, for COVID-19, people generally develop symptoms five days after infection, but can develop symptoms as early as two days and as late as 14 days. 
                                </li>

                                    For COVID-19, someone can spread the virus for roughly two days before showing symptoms. They can also stay contagious for at least 10 days after they initially start showing symptoms. For the most part, people with the flu are contagious one day before showing symptoms. Older children and adults are the most contagious during the first 3-4 days of being infected, and generally stay contagious for seven days. Infants and immunocompromised people can be contagious for longer than seven days.

                                    If you were close (as in, roughly within six feet) to someone who tests positive for COVID-19, testing is important - <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html' target='_blank'>even if you feel fine.</a> Additionally, if you used the same objects, utensils, or living spaces that they did, it’s important to quarantine. To monitor your symptoms effectively, take your temperature regularly if you <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html' target='_blank'>suspect you have the virus</a> and pay close attention to a fever (100.4◦F), coughing, or shortness of breath.
